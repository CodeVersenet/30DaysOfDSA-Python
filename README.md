# Day 3 - #30DaysOfDSA Challenge

Welcome to Day 3 of my #30DaysOfDSA challenge!  
Today, I practiced two classic problems involving Arrays and Strings using **Two Pointer** and **Sliding Window** techniques.


## Problem 1: Move Zeroes 
- Topic: Array, Two Pointers  

LeetCode #283

Topic: Array, Two Pointers

#Description:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Do it in-place with O(1) extra space.

Python Solution:
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums):
        non_zero_pos = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0:
                nums[non_zero_pos], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[non_zero_pos]
                non_zero_pos += 1
        return nums

# Example usage
nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
sol = Solution()
result = sol.moveZeroes(nums)
print("After moving zeroes:", result)
#Output:
After moving zeroes: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

#Key Concepts:
Two Pointer Technique.
In-place array manipulation.
Preserves order of non-zero elements.

##  Day7 of #30DaysOfDSA - LeetCode Challenge 


Today, I focused on mastering **Linked List** problems by solving two fundamental challenges on LeetCode:
## Problem 1: [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### Key Concepts:
- Linked List Manipulation
- Iterative and Recursive Approach
- Pointers (prev, curr, next)

### Approach:
Reversed a singly linked list using both **iterative** and **recursive** methods. Focused on understanding pointer movement and memory references.

## Problem 2: [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

### Key Concepts:
- Linked List
- Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)
- Fast and Slow Pointers

### Approach:
Used Floydâ€™s cycle detection technique to determine if a cycle exists in the linked list. This is a very efficient algorithm with **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space complexity.

## Tools Used:
- Language: **Python**
- Platform: **LeetCode**
- Editor: **VS Code**

## What I Learned:
- Mastery of basic linked list operations
- Understanding cycle detection in constant space
- Importance of pointer manipulation in interview-style problems


#  Day 8 - LeetCode Challenge

## Problem Solved:
**225. Implement Stack using Queues**  
[Link to problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/)

## Problem Statement:
Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. You must use only standard operations of a queue.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts:
- Stack and Queue simulation
- Using Python `deque` for queue operations
- Push Costly method: reordering elements during push to maintain stack order
- Time Complexity:
  - Push: O(n)
  - Pop: O(1)
  - Top: O(1)
  - Empty: O(1)

---

##  Learning:
- Simulating one data structure using another sharpens logical thinking
- Importance of order manipulation to preserve behavior
- `deque` in Python is very flexible and efficient

## Code:
python
from collections import deque

class MyStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()
   def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q.append(x)
        for _ in range(len(self.q) - 1):
            self.q.append(self.q.popleft())
    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q.popleft()
    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q[0]
    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.q
